# My Dissertation

This repository contains code related to my dissertation research. I am designing a framework that
would allow local governements to utilize social media data as a decision support tool. Have a look
at my [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04124) if you would like to learn more.

Feedback is highly appreciated! Just drop me an e-mail:
